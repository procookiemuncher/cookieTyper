An automatic typer that works on most websites and bypasses anti-copy-and-paste protections, allowing you to paste whatever you want on any website


## FAQ

#### Support âœ…

Currently, Cookie Typer is working on expanding support across many different websites. However, for now, it should work on all websites except server-side protected websites or any website that restricts the use of the developer console.

#### Security & User detection ðŸ”’

Cookie Typer is based on an obfuscated source code, making it harder for developers to detect code being injected into their websites. Unfortunately, this is the reason we cannot make Cookie Typer open-source. It is highly recommended to use this with caution, as some websites are stricter about running code in their console than others.

#### Anti-Detection Methods ðŸŒ 

Some ways I recommend staying undetected include using alt accounts when pasting any code on a website to avoid bans or repercussions. I also highly recommend using a VPN when using our tool, as some websites may detect Cookie Typer as malicious.

### Cracking and Reversing 

#### Reversing SRC ðŸ‘¾

You are more than welcome to reverse-engineer our code, use it, sell it, or modify it as you wish. We allow this because we want the community to be more informed about cybersecurity topics, such as manipulating a website's source code. However, as mentioned before, we cannot provide the source code due to user security concerns.
